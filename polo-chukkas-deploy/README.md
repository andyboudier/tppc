# Tedworth Park Polo Club — Chukkas

Tournament and club-chukka management for **Tedworth Park Polo Club (TPPC)**.
One React codebase runs as a public **website** and, via Capacitor, as native
**iOS and Android apps** — all sharing a single live Firebase dataset.

What it does:

- **Club chukka booking** — members sign up per day (Wed / Thu / Fri / Sat / Sun),
  set availability and preferences; the app draws balanced 4-a-side chukkas.
- **Tournament fixtures** — a full 2026 grass-season fixture list, team sign-ups,
  match details, and squads.
- **Live match scoring** — a public scoreboard with captain-entered scores,
  HPA head-start handicapping, and an iOS Lock-Screen / Dynamic-Island Live Activity.
- **PDF programmes** — printable single-day, full-tournament, results-summary and
  division team-sheet programmes, with an embedded Jost typeface.
- **Player & team management** — a player database, team database, subsidies,
  lessons and payment tracking.
- **Captain mode** — a PIN-gated editing mode; everyone else sees a read-only view.

British spelling throughout: *colour*, *programme*, *chukkas*.

Total hosting cost: **£0/month** on Firebase's and Vercel's free tiers.

## Repository layout

The app is **not** at the repo root — it lives in [`polo-chukkas-deploy/`](.).
Run every command from there.

## Quick start (local development)

```bash
cd polo-chukkas-deploy
npm install
npm run dev            # Vite dev server, usually http://localhost:5173
```

The Firebase config is already wired to the club's live project
(`tedworth-park-polo`) in `src/firebase.js`, so a fresh checkout syncs against
real club data immediately. Open two browser tabs and add a player in one — it
appears in the other within milliseconds. That is the Firestore live-sync
working (`src/storage.js`).

### Validate & build

```bash
# Type-check a JSX edit without a full build:
esbuild src/PoloChukkas.jsx --loader:.jsx=jsx --outfile=/dev/null

# Production build (outputs to dist/):
npm run build
```

For any handicap / scheduling / scoring change, write a small Node simulation and
run it — **do not** grep raw PDF output to verify formulae (special characters
such as `½` and `–` are encoded as WinAnsi bytes, so UTF-8 substring search on the
raw PDF is unreliable). See **[docs/DOMAIN_RULES.md](docs/DOMAIN_RULES.md)**.

## How it's deployed

- **Web:** Vercel auto-deploys from `main`. A commit reaches the live web app in
  ~90 seconds. Each branch/PR also gets a Vercel preview build — check that first.
- **Installed iOS apps:** the native app is a **remote-load wrapper**
  (`capacitor.config.ts` points at `https://tppc-chukkas.vercel.app`), so web
  changes reach already-installed iOS apps within ~90 seconds too — **no rebuild**.
- **Native changes** (splash screen, plugins, the Live Activity widget) do **not**
  ride that path — they go through **Xcode Cloud → TestFlight** on the next iOS build.
- **Android:** a manual GitHub Actions workflow
  (`.github/workflows/android-release.yml`) builds a signed `.aab` for the Play
  Console; it does not run on every commit.

Full detail — including the caching rules that keep the ~90s path working — is in
**[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## Data & access model

- **Firestore**, project `tedworth-park-polo`: public unauthenticated reads/writes.
- All editing is gated behind **captain mode**, unlocked with a 4-digit PIN. This is
  a soft gate for a club setting, **not** hard security — do not treat it as such,
  and never commit the PIN or any secret to the repo.
- Two collections: `shared` (everything club-wide) and `private`. Every shared key
  the app relies on must be listed in `src/storage.js` or it will not live-sync
  across devices — see the Architecture doc.

## Contributing

1. Work on a branch; open a PR. Check the branch's Vercel preview before asking for
   a merge to `main`.
2. Validate JSX with the `esbuild` command above before committing.
3. Keep British spelling.
4. Mind the gotchas (documented in **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)**):
   don't add `@capacitor/filesystem` or `@capacitor/share` (they break Xcode
   Cloud's committed `Package.resolved`), and make surgical edits to `package.json`
   so local Capacitor entries aren't clobbered.
