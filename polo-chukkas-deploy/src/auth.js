// Who is using the app, and what they may do.
//
// The app reads `window.auth` the same way it reads `window.storage`: a small
// object with a fixed shape that a deployment may replace. This file installs
// the default — sign-in switched off — which is exactly the app as it has
// always been: nobody logs in, anyone may put their name on a chukka list, and
// the captain PIN unlocks everything.
//
// A deployment that wants real logins assigns its own provider to
// `window.auth` before the app renders (the PoloACT demo does this with
// Firebase Auth). Then:
//
//   role 'anon'    sees fixtures, the draw and live scores, but cannot book.
//   role 'member'  is signed in: books chukkas under their own name, and can
//                  take their own entry off a list.
//   role 'admin'   runs the club: chukka lists, the player database,
//                  tournaments, the team board, shop and payments — everything
//                  the captain PIN used to cover.
//
// The captain PIN stays, but with sign-in on it unlocks live scoring only, so
// whoever is on the boards can enter goals without being made an admin.
//
// The shape a provider must honour:
//
//   enabled   true when sign-in is on
//   ready     false until the first sign-in state is known (so the app does not
//             flash "sign in" at someone who is already signed in)
//   methods   which buttons to offer: 'password', 'link', 'google', 'apple'
//   user      null | { uid, email, displayName }
//   role      'anon' | 'member' | 'admin'
//   profile   null | { name, handicap, mobile, hpa } — what the member plays as
//
//   signInWithPassword(email, password)
//   createAccount(email, password)
//   sendPasswordReset(email)
//   sendSignInLink(email)          the link lands back on the app and signs in
//   signInWithGoogle() / signInWithApple()
//   signOut()
//   saveProfile({ name, handicap, mobile, hpa })
//   listAdmins() → [email]         admins only
//   setAdmins([email])             admins only
//
// A provider dispatches `auth-changed` on window whenever any of user, role,
// profile or ready changes; useAuth() below re-reads the snapshot.
