// the app's own loading screen (crest + spinner) takes over, so the user sees

//
// launchAutoHide deliberately stays TRUE in capacitor.config.ts: it is the
// failsafe. If this code never runs — the bundle fails to load, or the device
// is offline on a cold start — the splash still clears on its own rather than
// leaving the app looking frozen. Hiding early here and auto-hiding late there
// are complementary, not alternatives.

// (e.g. a WebView without service-worker support) is ignored and the app runs as
// before.
