/*
 * TPPC Chukkas — app-shell service worker.
 *
 * Goal: stop the JS/CSS shell being re-downloaded on every cold start, WITHOUT
 * breaking the ~90s web-update mechanism that installed apps rely on.
 *
 * How the ~90s path is preserved:
 *   - Navigations / index.html use NETWORK-FIRST. When online you always get the
 *     freshest index.html, which references the newest content-hashed asset URLs,
 *     so a new Vercel deploy is picked up immediately (same as today). The cached
 *     copy is only a fallback for when the network is unavailable.
 *   - /assets/* files are content-hashed and immutable (Vite fingerprints them,
 *     and vercel.json already serves them `immutable`). They use CACHE-FIRST: once
 *     fetched they are served from the Cache Storage on subsequent cold starts and
 *     never re-downloaded. A new build emits new filenames, which simply get cached
 *     on first use; the old ones linger harmlessly and are pruned on activate.
 *
 * Anything cross-origin (Firestore, Google Fonts, FCM) is NOT intercepted — those
 * requests pass straight through untouched.
 *
 * This worker's logic is static: it never needs to change per deploy, because the
 * freshness guarantee comes from network-first HTML + content-hashed assets, not
 * from a precache manifest. vercel.json serves /sw.js with no-cache so any future
 * edit here is still picked up promptly.
